                            event of any conflict. Any modifications to these Terms will not retroactively alter any
                            contractual agreements unless explicitly agreed upon in writing to the contrary. The Terms
                            otherwise apply to any resources and tools provided through the Websites, including but not
                            limited to developer tools, software, download areas, research areas, community forums, chat

                            made available on the Websites such as white papers, press releases, datasheets, and
                            specification documents but do not extend to any separate agreements you may enter through
                            the Website’s electronic signature tool. Hereafter, the foregoing documents will be referred

                            accessible via the Websites may have their own supplementary terms and conditions specific

                            bound by the applicable supplementary terms and conditions. These Terms will apply and
                            remain in effect with respect to those Materials and sub-sites, provided that, to the extent
                            these Terms conflict with or are superseded by any such supplementary terms and conditions,

                            Terms”). Modified Terms will be effective when posted by Intel, and your use of the Websites
                            or the Materials after the posting of the Modified Terms will be deemed your acceptance of
                            and agreement to be bound by the Modified Terms. The date on which the Modified Terms are
                            posted will be stated at the beginning of the Modified Terms. If you do not agree to the
                            Modified Terms, you must stop using the Websites and Materials. Notwithstanding the
                            foregoing, Modified Terms will not impact the terms of any Agreement executed through an
                            electronic signature tool on the Websites without prior written consent of the parties

                            convenience only and that the English-language versions of these Terms will govern your
                            relationship with Intel. If there is any contradiction between the English-language version
                            of these Terms and the translation, the English-language version will govern and control.
